DRI Experiment Model
====================

The general algorithm is like this:

1. Encoding phase
   1.1 Encode rule as a pair ("Odd/Left/Nosearch" or "Odd/A/Search")
   1.2 Proceed

2. Execution phase
   2.1 Encode number
   2.2 Decide whether even or odd
   2.3 Check whether parity matches encoded rule
   
   2.4 If it matches:
   2.4.1 If it the modality is Nosearch, press hand.
   2.4.2 If the answer is "Search", lookf for Letter
   2.4.2 If you have found letter, and parity matches, press the
   button

   2.5 If it does not match
   2.5.1 If the modality is Nosearch, press the other hand
   2.5.2 If the modality is Search, look
